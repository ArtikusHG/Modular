# Modular
A whole new control center for iOS.
Changelog:
- pre-release: initial release
- beta: completely remake the tweak with a whole new concept blahblahblah. Should now be fine on most devices; however I didn't test it. All 100% works, just not sure about scaling.
- beta (22/08/2k17): scaling was tested and is 100% fine on iPhones, iPads have it fine in portrait. Landscape also works, but only on iPhones. Sorry about this. Actual changes - none instead of using another method which exists in iOS 7 - 9 so the custom CC appears on these version. There might be a better way to do this; however I just copypasted code from iOS 10 method to 7 - 9 one.
